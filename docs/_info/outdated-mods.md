title: Outdated Mods
---
Spore modding has been around for over 15 years, and many older mods have not been updated to be compatible with newer game versions.

## General guidelines
- Mods released in 2018 or later are almost always compatible with the [game versions supported by the Launcher Kit](game-versions).
- Mods released in 2010-2017 *may* be compatible, but not always. It is better to look for a newer version, if possible.
- Mods released in 2009 or earlier should not be expected to work. In particular, mods released before Galactic Adventures should not be used.

## Mods known to be outdated
The mods listed here are known to be incompatible with the game versions supported by the Launcher Kit, and should be not be used. Use these mods at your own risk.

- BetterSpore

- OrbitSpore
- ForgottenSpore
- TitanSpore
- Dark Injection versions prior to 9.r Beta 2.3.2

## Dark Injection
While Dark Injection has historically been a popular mod to install, and the latest version (9.r Beta 2.3.2) works with the latest game version, the mod has been left in an unfinished and unpolished state, and has multiple known issues. As a result, we no longer recommend the mod.

If you still want to use Dark Injection for its parts, you may use the mod, but it is strongly recommended to disable all non-essential options. Some of these options cause crashes, graphical issues, or incompatibilities with other mods. In particular, do not use the Full Darkspore UI or Darkspore Beta UI, and disable all options except the part categories.

Please note that even with these options disabled, there are still known issues and incompatibilities that cannot be fixed without fully uninstalling Dark Injection.
