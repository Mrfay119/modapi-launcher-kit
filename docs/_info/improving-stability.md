title: Improving Game Stability
---
Spore has a number of bugs and crashes that have never officially been fixed. Some of these can be resolved using external tools and mods.

---

## SporeCrashFix
This mod fixes crashes that occur in several *specific* scenarios, such as when dying in creature stage. It does not fix all crashes, but is highly recommended to fix some of the most common crashes in the game.

## 4GB Patch (Large Address Aware)
Spore is an older game and is not optimized to take full advantage of modern computers. This external tool patches the game to use more memory, doubling from the historical Windows default of 2GB, to 4GB (internally known as being "large address aware"). This can reduce crashes that occur if the game exceeds the normal Windows memory limitations.

This is not a Spore-specific patch and should not be confused with official Spore patches, such as patch 1.5.1.

#### Disc and GOG
Apply the 4GB patch to `SporeApp.exe` in the `SporebinEP1` folder.

#### Steam
The 4GB patch is not compatible with the latest Steam version of the game due to Steam's DRM. You must first [downgrade the game](game-versions).

After downgrading, apply the 4GB patch to the newly-downloaded `SporeApp.exe` in the `SporebinEP1` folder.

#### EA App
Apply the 4GB patch to `SporeApp_ModAPIFix.exe` in the `SporebinEP1` folder.

#### Linux and Mac users
The 4GB patch is performed automatically by the Windows compatibility layer. No additional steps are required.
