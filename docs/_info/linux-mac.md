title: Linux & Mac Support
---
The Launcher Kit is not optimized for use on Linux or Mac, which both use a Windows compatibility layer to run the game. On these platforms, it is instead recommended to use **SporeModLoader**.

This does not require the use of a Launcher app, as it allows mods to be loaded directly by the game itself. On platforms like Steam Deck, this means you can launch Spore Galactic Adventures normally from the Steam UI.

A command-line mod manager app is included to install, list, and uninstall mods. It supports all the same mods as the Launcher Kit, including both .sporemod and .package formats, and provides all the same configuration options for mods that use them.

SporeModLoader may also be used on Windows, if preferred over the Launcher Kit.

*Note: Do not use the Launcher Kit and SporeModLoader at the same time. Only install mods using one of them. Remove the files for SporeModLoader before using the Launcher Kit.*
