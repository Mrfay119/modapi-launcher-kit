title: Galaxy Reset
---
Because all campaign games take place in a single galaxy, mods that alter certain elements may require resetting the entire galaxy, for the mod to take effect. This does mean you will lose *all* saved games.

The Easy Installer will warn you when installing a mod that requires a galaxy reset. It does *not* reset the galaxy automatically, to ensure you can create your own backup copy, if needed.

---

## Locating the galaxy files
Press Win+R and type in `%appdata%\Spore`. The `Games` folder contains your galaxy.

## Creating a backup
Copy or rename the `Games` folder. It can be left in the same Spore folder, or copied to another location. Give it a name, so you can identify it later - for example, the date, or the names of planets or species in that galaxy.

To restore this backup at a later date, copy this backup folder back to its original place and name. You can have many different galaxies, each in a different folder, and swap between them as desired.

## Generating a new galaxy
If there is no folder called `Games` in the Spore folder, the game will generate a new galaxy the next time you launch the game. The effects of mods that require a galaxy reset should be visible in the newly-generated galaxy.

## Alternatives to manually swapping the Games folder
You can alternatively use a mod which performs these steps automatically. [Find it here]({{ page.multiplesaves_mod_url }})
