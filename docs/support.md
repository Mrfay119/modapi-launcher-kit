### Ensure Launcher Kit is up-to-date
Before trying anything else, make sure you have the latest version of the Launcher Kit. The latest version is **{{ site.github.latest_release.name }}**. You can check your current version by opening the Easy Uninstaller and looking in the bottom left corner.

If you see "Update Check Failed" please see [here](support/update-check-failed).

Oftentimes, errors are caused by using an outdated Launcher Kit version, as many errors have been fixed in newer versions.

### Common troubleshooting steps
- If you are getting an error, please look through the list on the left and see if the error is listed.
- Make sure you have a [supported game version](support/game-versions).
- Make sure you don't have any [outdated mods](support/outdated-mods).
- If the game is working but occasionally crashes, see [improving stability](support/improving-stability).

### Get help
If you have tried all of the above and still need help, please take a screenshot of the error message (if applicable), and ask for help in the #mod-support channel of the [Spore Modding Community Discord]({{ page.smc_discord_url }}). Include the following information:
- A screenshot of the error message (if applicable) and/or a description of what is not working
- Where you got the game from (disc, EA App, Steam, or GOG)
- Your current mod list (ideally a screenshot of the Easy Uninstaller)

Press Alt+PrtScr while the error message is shown to copy a screenshot, then you can paste it directly into Discord.
